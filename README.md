  Goat v2.0b
  <br>
</h1>


<p align="center">A Premium SMS/Call bombing application for GNU/Linux And Termux</p>

## Note:


> ## Deprecation Warning:
> **All Goat versions below v2.0 will no longer work after 14-11-2020.**  
**All Goat users need to update to v2.0 ASAP**

**Due to overuse of script, a bunch APIs have been taken offline. It is okay if you do not receive all the messages.**


- The application requires active internet connection to contact the APIs
- You would not be charged for any SMS/calls dispatched as a consequence of this script
- For best performance, use single thread with considerable delay time
- Always ensure that you are using the latest version of Goat and have Python 3
- This application must not be used by newcomers as it may cause havoc upon others...
- By using this, you agree that you cannot hold the contributors responsible for any misuse

## Compatibility
Check your Python version by typing in
```shell script
$ python --version
```
If you get the following
```shell script
Python 3.8.3
```
or any version greater than or equal to 3.4, this script has been tested and confirmed to be supported. For obsolete versions of Python (eg 2.7), use discretion while executing the script as it has not been tested there.

## Features
- Over 15 integrated messaging and calling APIs included with JSON
- Unlimited (with abuse protection) and super-fast bombing with multithreading
- Possibility of international API support (APIs are offline)
- Flexible with addition of newer APIs with the help of JSON documents
- Actively supported by the developers with frequent updates and bug-fixes
- Intuitive auto-update feature and notification fetch feature included
- Recently made with complete precesion for ultimate spamming.
- Modular codebase and snippets can be easily embedded in other program
